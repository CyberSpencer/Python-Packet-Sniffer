This repository contains the `Python_Packet_Sniffer2.py` script, a Python-based packet sniffer tool that leverages Scapy to capture and analyze network packets. The captured packet details are saved in a CSV file on your desktop for further analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** Scapy
- **Modules:** argparse, threading, time, psutil, socket, os, datetime, csv

## üéÆ How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `Python_Packet_Sniffer2.py`.
3. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal (use admin/sudo) :
    ```bash
    python Python_Packet_Sniffer2.py
    ```

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time packet capture and analysis.
- Display active network interface.
- Captures IP, TCP, and UDP packets.
- Identifies sensitive port activities.
- Exports packet data to a CSV file.

## üîÑ Program Flow

1. The script begins by identifying the active network interface.
2. It then starts sniffing packets on that interface.
3. As packets are captured, the script checks for any activity on sensitive ports like SSH, Telnet, HTTP, and HTTPS.
4. All unique socket information is saved, and upon completion of sniffing, the data is written to a CSV file on your desktop.
